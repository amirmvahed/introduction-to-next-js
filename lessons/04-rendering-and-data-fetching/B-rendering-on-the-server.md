# Rendering on the server

In addition to client-side and server-side rendering with React components, Next.js gives you the option to optimize
rendering on the server with Static and Dynamic Rendering.

## Static Rendering

With Static Rendering, both Server and Client Components can be pre-rendered on the server at `build time`. The result
of
the work is `cached` and reused on subsequent requests. The cached result `can also be revalidated`.

## Dynamic Rendering
With Dynamic Rendering, both Server and Client Components are rendered on the server at `request time`. The result of the work `is not cached`.
