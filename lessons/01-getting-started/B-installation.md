&nbsp;

is recommended to create a new Next.js app using create-next-app, which sets up everything automatically for you. To create
a project, run:

> npx create-next-app@13.4

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

> What is your project named? app-name **(make sure your name doesn't use capital char)**
> 
> Would you like to use TypeScript with this project? **No** / Yes
> 
> Would you like to use ESLint with this project? **No** / Yes 
> 
> Would you like to use Tailwind CSS with this project? **No** / Yes
> 
> Would you like to use src/ directory with this project? **No** / Yes
> 
> Use App Router (recommended)? No / **Yes**
> 
> Would you like to customize the default import alias? **No** / Yes

After the prompts, `create-next-app` will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

You now have a new directory called **app-name**. Letâ€™s cd into it:
> cd app-name

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Then, run the following command:
> npm run dev

You can see your app on <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000</a>
&nbsp;


if you see this, that`s great:
